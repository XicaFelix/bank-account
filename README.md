# Bank Account Assignment

## Description
This assignment highlights the use of object oriented programming in Python. It features two classes: `BankAccount`, which creates an individual bank account, and `Bank`, which holds multiple accounts as a list. Through `Bank`, a user can create an individual `BankAccount` and then perform different actions such as deposit, print statements, and transfer. In `Bank` a user needs to supply a account number to interact with the accounts. The assignment also makes use of user generated input in the `application.py` file.
